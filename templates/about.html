<h2>Lucas Domulevicz</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Luke. I'm an Electrical Engineering and Physics professional with more than 8 years of experience performing high-impact, collaborative research in academic settings on nano-electronics and machine learning. I am enthusiastic about leveraging the powerful methods in machine learning and artificial neural networks to understand complex relationships in data and facilitate the deployment of smarter technologies.</p>
<p>I value lifelong learning and cherish the opportunity to share my knowledge with others whether that be in the form of presenting a story hidden in data, publishing research on cutting edge technologies, or teaching a general audience about fascinating discoveries (new and old) in science and engineering. As such, I endeavor to put myself on the front lines of innovation and technology.</p>
<p>I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of California, Davis and am currently looking for a role that will allow me to express my creativity through engineering and feed my insatiable curiosity. If you would like to see some of the work I've done, feel free to take a look at my project portfolio: <a href="https://lkdomule137.github.io/Lucas_Domulevicz_Portfolio/">Lucas Domulevicz Portfolio</a></p>
<p>Experience with machine learning and data science: programming in Python, SQL, R, MATLAB, C/C++, and LabView. Extensive experience with Python packages for data processing and visualization (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) and developing machine learning models (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras), particularly deep neural networks for regression and classification, computer vision (OpenCV), natural language processing, and time series forecasting. Skilled at producing high quality visual representations of data using Origin, Tableau, and PowerPoint for publication in scientific literature and conference proceedings.</p>
<p>Hobbies: Avid long distance runner, mediocre guitarist, and lifelong tinkerer. <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/lkdomulevicz137">LinkedIn</a> <a href="mailto:lkdomulevicz@gmail.com">lkdomulevicz@gmail.com</a></p>

<h2>Travis Kessler</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m Dr. Travis Kessler, alumnus of the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. My research focuses on machine learning and artificial intelligence, and applications include developing multivariate regression models to predict key combustion properties of potentially cleaner and more efficient liquid fuels.</p>
<p>In addition to having experience with machine learning models such as neural networks, I have significant interest in optimization algorithms such as artificial bee colonies and other genetically inspired algorithms for use in a variety of applications across STEM.</p>
<p>Skilled in applied machine learning, data mining/pipelining, probability and statistics, and software engineering development/management. <a href="mailto:travis.j.kessler@gmail.com">travis.j.kessler@gmail.com</a> <a href="https://traviskessler.com">traviskessler.com</a> <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/traviskessler">LinkedIn</a></p>
